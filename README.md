# SRF Replay (another Kodi Plugin)

## Migration
This plugin has been migrated from [SRF Podcast Plugin](https://kodi.wiki/view/Add-on:SRF_Podcast_Plugin) [[source code](https://github.com/ambermoon/xbmc_plugin_video_srf_podcast_ch)] as its development seems to be on hold and unfortunately the plugin is not compatible with the newest Kodi version anymore. Thanks to all the previous developers who maintained the original plugin that I used and appreciated a lot.

## Plugin description
The plugin has been renamed to "SRF Replay". It only supports the SRF channel and the only feature is to list and play all TV shows. All other channels and features from the original plugin have been refactored out. You might ask yourself 'Why?'. Well, never put avocado on a burger! Simple is always best!

## Installation

### Manual
Just zip the `plugin.video.srf_ch_replay` folder and install it manually on Kodi 19.0 through the addon menu.

### Kodi repository
Will it be available in the Kodi 19 repository any time soon? It might as soon as the code has been refactored to my satisfaction.
